# openElement

English | [Simplified Chinese](./README.zh.md)

**JSX-first Web Components platform. Package line: `0.40.0` (`v0.40.0`
release). Active execution: `v0.40.0` Elements + Preact + Repository
Slimming.**

openElement builds static-first applications with Web Components, JSX/VNode
rendering, progressive islands, API routes, and Vite + Nitro output. Shadow/DSD
is the default component render mode; light DOM is explicit opt-in.

Mandatory project workflow:

## Quick Start

```bash
deno run -A jsr:@openelement/create my-app
cd my-app
deno task dev
```

## Product Matrix

```text
openElement = Elements + UI + Framework + Protocols
```

| Product   | Surface                                   | Role                                                                    |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Elements  | `@openelement/element`, `OpenElement`     | Native Web Components authoring layer, competing with Lit and FAST.     |
| UI        | `@openelement/ui`                         | First-party `open-*` components built on the Elements model.            |
| Framework | `@openelement/app`, `@openelement/create` | Pages, layouts, islands, API routes, Vite + Nitro build/runtime output. |
| Protocols | `@openelement/protocol`                   | Runtime-free replacement boundaries and conformance contracts.          |

Supporting packages such as `@openelement/core`, `adapter-vite`, `signals`,
`router`, `content`, and `i18n` are advanced or implementation surfaces. They
support the four products; they are not separate first-class product lines.

In v0.40.x, the active workspace is the 11-package cleanup-train product line.
Hub, RPC, CEM, compat-check, Lit/React/vanilla interop adapters, and standalone
runtime/style-sheet/ssg packages are removed from the current package graph;
historical details remain in git history and release evidence.

## Why openElement

openElement renders Web Components on the server through Declarative Shadow DOM
where that mode is selected. Static content ships as HTML first. Interactive
pieces are islands that upgrade only when their hydration strategy says they
should.

```tsx
import { definePage } from '@openelement/app';

export default definePage({
  route: { path: '/' },
  head: { title: 'Home' },
  render() {
    return <main>Hello openElement</main>;
  },
});
```

For browser-upgraded UI:

```tsx
import { defineIsland } from '@openelement/app';
import { signal } from '@openelement/element';

const count = signal(0);

export default defineIsland(
  'my-counter',
  () => <button onClick={() => count.value++}>Count: {count.value}</button>,
);
```

## Current Line

All 11 current workspace packages are aligned at **0.40.0** (`v0.40.0`) under
[`@openelement`](https://jsr.io/@openelement). The active execution line is
**v0.40.0**. ADR-0101 keeps AutoFlow3 as the single workflow/gate control plane
while reserving minor/major product decisions for human-approved ADR and
version-plan evidence.

v0.40.x removes Hub, RPC, CEM, compat-check, Lit/React/vanilla interop
adapters, and standalone runtime/style-sheet/ssg packages from the current
product line, keeps Vite + Nitro as the Framework base, and keeps Preact island
work bounded behind the v0.40 plan.

The v1.0 target is a stable four-product platform with frozen Elements, UI,
Framework, and Protocols contracts.
