# openElement Project Status

> AI assistant: read this file first on every session start.

Mandatory workflow: `docs/governance/PROJECT_WORKFLOW.md`. Active version plan:
`docs/current/VERSION_PLAN.md`.

## Current Version Line: v0.40.0 Released (Elements + Preact + Repository Slimming)

v0.40.0 is released as the product-line cleanup release. It keeps the public
target at `openElement = Elements + UI + Framework + Protocols`, makes the
active package line `0.40.0`, and narrows the workspace to 11 packages. Hub,
RPC, CEM, compat-check, Lit/React/vanilla interop adapters, and standalone
runtime/style-sheet/ssg packages are removed from the current package graph.
Hub routes and registry data are also removed from the website output.

Public package names are singular: `@openelement/element`,
`@openelement/protocol`, and `@openelement/signal`. Active code, tests, tools,
and www active code enforce 0 explicit `any` through the `type-safety:check`
gate.

ADR-0101 is the governance boundary for this line. ADR-0105 approves the
v0.40.0 breaking cleanup train consolidated into the v0.40.0 release. AutoFlow3
is the workflow, gate, evidence, and release-state control plane, but it cannot
decide minor/major product scope, public API, package topology, default runtime,
default signal engine, security/auth/database ownership, or release policy
without human ADR or approved version-plan evidence.

Local v0.40.0 evidence passes: `fmt:check`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`,
`build`, `graph:check`, `arch:check`, `repo:hygiene`, `workflow:check`,
`workflow:check-slimming`, `docs:check-public`, `docs:check-current`,
`docs:check-strategy`, `package-surface:check`,
`signals:check-protocol-boundary`, `type-safety:check`, `autoflow:push`,
`autoflow:ci`, `nitro:proof:node`, `nitro:proof:workers`, `consumer:local`,
`consumer:core-smoke`, and `publish:dry-run`. JSR publish and post-publish
smoke evidence are required for final release closure.

## Prior Version Line: v0.39.0 (Framework RC + Four-Product Matrix Reset)

v0.39.0 is released. It proved generated starter behavior from
`@openelement/create`, pages/layouts/islands/API routes/static output, assets,
SSR/ISR intent, and Nitro runtime behavior through `consumer:local`, aligned
docs/templates with the four-product matrix, excluded Web Awesome from the
current target, and recorded Preact as the v0.40 heavy-framework island
priority. JSR publish evidence passed in `Publish to JSR` run `27425438225`.
The old v0.39 architecture state is frozen on `arch/v0.39-line`; `dev` is the
product-line reset branch.

## Prior Version Line: v0.38.0 (Product Surface Reset)

v0.38.0 is released. Tag `v0.38.0` and the GitHub release exist at commit
`e729bee4`. All 20 `@openelement/*` workspace packages are aligned to
`0.38.0`. Local implementation and post-bump release gates passed; `dev` and
`main` non-JSR CI passed before tag/release. Local JSR publish evidence ran
after release and confirmed all 20 package versions already existed on JSR, so
the publish task skipped immutable versions successfully.

v0.38.0 turned the v0.37.x protocol and Nitro evidence into a documented public
product/package surface. It recorded a package/subpath inventory,
product-surface classification, and product map under `docs/next/v0.38.0/`.
The product map retains existing package names, classifies Hub as archived for
the v1 public product map, and moves internal build/tooling packages out of
first-run documentation. Root README, README.zh,
`docs/arch/current-architecture.md`, package READMEs, website guide/API pages,
and `@openelement/create` templates now separate product, advanced, internal,
and archived surfaces. Migration notes record the starter import-map change,
archived RPC status, and internal SSG status.

## Prior Version Line: v0.37.6 (Vite + Nitro Runtime Proof)

v0.37.6 is released. Tag `v0.37.6` and the GitHub release exist at commit
`19d77dee`. All 20 `@openelement/*` workspace packages are aligned to
`0.37.6`. The implementation exposes the openElement universal request handler
from the generated route pipeline, keeps the Nitro boundary in
`@openelement/adapter-vite`, and proves that boundary through a real Nitro
fixture under `fixtures/nitro-proof/`.

Local evidence: `deno task nitro:proof:node` builds Nitro `node-server` output
and verifies the mounted openElement Web `Response`, public asset serving,
route/render behavior, explicit island minimality, static zero-JS output, API
routes, and Nitro-owned cache-control for `/isr`. `deno task
nitro:proof:workers` builds Nitro `cloudflare-module` output and verifies the
generated Workers server entry, wrangler config, public asset, openElement
route/render markers, and route-rule cache markers. Local, `dev`, and `main`
non-JSR release gates passed. JSR publish ran locally and in CI under the
ADR-0097-era distribution policy.

## Prior Version Line: v0.37.5 (Protocol-First Runtime Architecture)

v0.37.5 is released. Tag `v0.37.5` and the GitHub release exist at commit
`e1016ec0`. All 20 `@openelement/*` workspace packages are aligned to
`0.37.5`, `ACTIVE_VERSION` points at `v0.37.5`, and local release gates passed
for workflow, graph, architecture, docs, format, lint, typecheck, test, build,
and publish dry-run. v0.37.5 establishes `@openelement/protocol` as the
replacement boundary for renderer, component, runtime, route, island, cache,
signal, and data contracts while positioning Vite + Nitro as the default base
engine for the v0.37.6 runtime proof.

ADR-0097 changed the release policy for that historical line: JSR package
visibility was no longer a version-exit gate, and registry health became a
release-note caveat.

## Prior Version Line: v0.37.4 (Hygiene + Pure CSS UI + Architecture Decoupling) - JSR Distribution Caveat

v0.37.4 implementation is complete. All 20 `@openelement/*` workspace packages
were aligned to `0.37.4`, tag `v0.37.4` exists, and the GitHub release exists.

Live registry state on 2026-06-11: `@openelement/rpc`,
`@openelement/protocol`, and `@openelement/router` are visible on JSR at
`0.37.4`; publish recovery has progressed to 15/20 packages. The first recovery
patch failed because a 5-minute per-package timeout interrupted
`@openelement/style-sheet` before JSR accepted the immutable version; the next
attempt proved the 20-minute window still fails for slower packages such as
`@openelement/content`. The current recovery patch uses a 45-minute package
window, keeps provenance enabled, polls live JSR version metadata during
`deno publish`, stops the hung publish process after the immutable version
becomes visible, extends the publish job to 360 minutes for the recovery path,
and makes post-publish consumer smoke wait for package-level `meta.json`
propagation before invoking a fresh `jsr:@openelement/create@0.37.4` consumer.

Follow-up registry check on 2026-06-12 with
`deno info --no-config jsr:@openelement/<pkg>@0.37.4` only resolved `rpc`,
`protocols`, `router`, `runtime`, and `cem`; key dependencies such as
`style-sheet`, `signals`, and `core` still failed package-level resolver
visibility. Treat 2026-06-11 registry counts as a historical recovery snapshot,
not release closure.

v0.37.4 delivered the 2026-06-10 audit hygiene fixes, ADR-0094 Core Type
Consolidation, adapter-vite deprecated shell removal, SSG ownership cleanup,
dsd-hydration helper deduplication, UI/router decoupling, a daisyUI-inspired
pure CSS foundation, three DsdElement interactive thin-shell proofs
(`open-dropdown`, `open-modal`, `open-tabs`), and test supplementation. Local
evidence recorded for the release: 1600 tests passed before publish recovery.

v0.37.3 (Data / Database Boundary) is done as a validation-train stop:
ADR-0095 accepted and implemented with MemoryDataAdapter baseline,
FileDataAdapter deferred to recipe, and the 2026-06-10 JSR publish hotfix
closed for the prior package line. v0.37.4 JSR distribution remains externally
unhealthy, but ADR-0097 prevents that external state from blocking roadmap
execution.

The active implementation line is now v0.40.0. It proceeds from v0.39.0
framework RC evidence while shrinking the current product line and gate surface.

v0.36.4 Status: **IMPLEMENTED.** It closed the Firefox/WebKit cross-browser
proof line, documented remaining browser-specific limitations, added the
cross-browser E2E gate, and bumped all 20 packages to 0.36.4.

v0.36.5 Status: **IMPLEMENTED.** It closed release-truth and AutoFlow drift
without product-code changes or package version bumps.

v0.37.0 Status: **IMPLEMENTED.** It reset the roadmap, SOP, ADR, NextVersion,
status, and website truth around the four-product validation train without
product-code changes.

v0.36.3 Status: **IMPLEMENTED.** It completed SSG file ownership migration so
`@openelement/ssg` owns route scanning, entry generation, generated data
resolution, SSG Vite plugin logic, render, and postprocess code. `adapter-vite`
is now Vite build orchestration glue.

v0.36.2 Status: **IMPLEMENTED.** It moved Vite-free SSG render and HTML
postprocess helpers into `@openelement/ssg`, while keeping adapter-vite as the
Vite shell for the remaining bridge work.

v0.36.1 Status: **IMPLEMENTED.** It closed the v0.36 release truth and AutoFlow
evidence gap with `cell-v0.36.1-001`, non-zero metrics, Windows-safe generated
test paths, and aligned v0.36.0 deferrals.

v0.36.0 Status: **IMPLEMENTED WITH DEFERRED ITEMS.** Delivered signals docs,
deployment docs, version sync, error-boundary retry/degraded fallback coverage,
FileIsrCache, `@openelement/ssg` Phase 1, parallel SSG evidence, and AutoFlow
built-in cell generation.

## Current Product Center

> openElement = Elements + UI + Framework + Protocols.

ADR-0099 defines the current product matrix:

| Product   | Current/future primary surface            | Status                                         |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Elements  | `@openelement/element`, `OpenElement`     | v0.40 product package facade over core         |
| UI        | `@openelement/ui`                         | First-party `open-*` component library         |
| Framework | `@openelement/app`, `@openelement/create` | Active v0.39 RC proof                          |
| Protocols | `@openelement/protocol`                   | Replacement boundary and conformance contracts |

Historical positioning note: earlier ADRs used the phrase DSD-first to protect
shadow/DSD output as the default. ADR-0096 refines that into Web Components
application framework identity, with shadow/DSD as the default render mode and
light DOM as first-class opt-in. ADR-0099 further refines the product matrix:
DSD/shadow is a default Elements render mode, not the product name.

## Current Rendering Mode

## Package Version State

The active v0.40 workspace contains 11 current `@openelement/*` packages aligned
to local version **0.40.0**. Published package availability still depends on JSR
publish and post-publish smoke evidence before release closure.

Package governance for v0.40:

- do not add a new top-level package without an ADR;
- ADR-0102 approves `@openelement/element`; the v0.40 roadmap now prioritizes
  Preact island proof over the earlier Vue adapter plan, and any later package
  topology change must update package count, release order, import maps, graph
  checks, docs, and migration notes;
- keep protocol contracts small and runtime-free;
- keep UI independent from framework routing;
- keep database, ORM, auth, backend, runtime, cache, storage, and deployment
  choices at protocol, adapter, or recipe boundaries.

v0.40 package governance approves a breaking cleanup from 21 historical packages
to the 11-package current surface. Future package deletion, package merge, new
package creation, package graph topology changes, default runtime changes, and
default signal-engine changes still require ADR-backed human approval under
ADR-0101.

The active package classification now lives in
`docs/current/PACKAGE_SURFACE.md`. The v0.40 reset removes Hub package, Hub
routes, Hub registry data, and Hub-specific workflows/tasks from the active
product path.

ADR-0102 approves `@openelement/element` as the first-class Elements package.
The workspace package count is now 11.

## Architecture Positioning

1. **Elements** - native Web Components authoring with JSX, signals, styles,
   shadow/DSD defaults, explicit light DOM opt-in, and the future
   `OpenElement` base class.
2. **UI** - first-party `open-*` components built on the Elements model and
   independent from framework routing.
3. **Framework** - `definePage()`, `defineIsland()`, file routes, layouts,
   `load()`, error/redirect/not-found behavior, SSG/SSR/ISR, API routes, and
   starter/create workflows.
4. **Protocols** - runtime-free contracts for renderer, component adapter,
   route manifest, island metadata, runtime adapter, cache/storage, data, and
   signal interoperability.
5. **Default engine bridge** - Vite owns module graph, plugin orchestration,
   client bundling, and HMR; Nitro owns production runtime, deployment output,
   platform presets, cache/storage, and route-rule plumbing.
6. **Supporting implementation surfaces** - core, adapter-vite, router,
   content, i18n, and signals support the four products without becoming
   separate product lines.

## Future Product Direction

- ADR-0099 supersedes the v0.38 package-name deferral for future work and
  approves the four-product matrix.
- Elements becomes a first-class product direction, with `OpenElement` replacing
  `DsdElement` terminology in future public APIs.
- Web Components remain the default component model, but renderer and component
  adapter protocols must not assume only one frontend framework.
- Shadow/DSD remains the default Elements render mode; explicit light DOM opt-in
  is a first-class supported mode.
- Vite + Nitro are the default base engine. Vite handles build/module graph and
  Nitro handles production runtime/deployment, but neither should leak as the
  primary user-facing application API.
- Protocols should grow through concrete conformance tests, not broad
  abstraction rewrites.
- UI remains first-party and Elements-based. Web Awesome is not part of the
  current target.
- Heavy-framework island expansion is frozen except for the planned v0.40
  Preact island proof.
- v0.40 owns the physical repository slimming work: root generated outputs, Hub data, active docs categories, 11-package surface checks, and duplicate gate orchestration must stay aligned with the four-product matrix.
- Database work belongs in data/database adapter contracts and recipes. It must
  not become a built-in ORM, auth platform, or migration system.
- A Vite + Nitro runtime proof should compose openElement routes, rendering,
  islands, assets, API routes, and ISR/cache intent before product-surface reset.
- Governance convergence before v1.0: gate tiers (fast dev gate for PRs,
  full release gate for publishing), AutoFlow feature scope freeze, Hub scope
  deferred to post-v1.0. See `docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md` v0.38.x for details.
- JSR publish is a v0.39+ release exit gate under ADR-0100. Release notes must
  not claim closure unless publish evidence or an ADR-approved exception exists.

## Key Decisions

- **Four-product matrix.** openElement is Elements + UI + Framework +
  Protocols; supporting packages do not become first-class products by
  existing in the workspace.
- **Elements product reset.** Future public element authoring centers on
  `@openelement/element` and `OpenElement`, not `DsdElement` terminology.
- **Application API first.** App authors write `definePage()` and
  `defineIsland()` before touching lower-level Elements APIs.
- **Vite config split.** `openElement()` is imported from
  `@openelement/app/vite`.
- **Vite + Nitro default engine.** Vite is the default build/module graph
  engine and Nitro is the planned default production runtime/deployment engine.
- **Protocol-first replacement boundary.** Renderer, component adapter, runtime,
  route manifest, island, cache/storage, signal, and data contracts belong in
  `@openelement/protocol` with conformance tests.
- **TemplateResult and string render removed.** JSX+Signal is the only component
  model. `render()` returns `VNode | null`.
- **Web Components product identity.** openElement is a Web Components
  application framework; DSD/shadow is the default render mode, not the entire
  product identity.
- **Static default 0JS.** Static routes should emit zero framework JavaScript
  unless islands, hydration, or client-only components are explicit.
- **SSR/ISR in framework core.** SSR and ISR belong to the framework product
  line and are not split into a fifth product.
- **Light DOM is opt-in.** Shadow/DSD remains the default Elements render mode.
  Light DOM support requires explicit API, tests, docs, and ADR coverage.
- **Current heavy island target.** Preact is the only planned heavy-framework
  island adapter proof for the pre-1.0 path; Vue, React, Svelte, and generic
  heavy-island expansion are frozen, and Web Awesome is out of scope.
- **Signal engine default.** `@preact/signals-core` is the default engine
  (since v0.40.0). `alien-signals` remains available as an optional engine
  via `@openelement/signal/alien-engine` and runtime `setSignalEngine()`.
- **No DOM diff.** Signal writes trigger scoped rerender behavior; complex
  subtrees stay in Islands.
- **Package graph gate.** `graph:check` verifies zero cycles, unified versions,
  and declared imports.
- **JSR publish exit gate restored.** `publish:dry-run` remains a local release
  gate, and live or CI JSR publish evidence is required for v0.39+ version
  closure. See ADR-0100.
- **SSG ownership.** `@openelement/ssg` owns SSG render, postprocess, route
  scanning, entry generation, generated data resolution, and SSG-specific Vite
  plugin logic.
- **AutoFlow2 boundary.** AutoFlow2 may report state, evidence, blockers, and
  allowed actions. It must not merge, tag, bump, publish, or replace human review
  for ADRs, public API resets, package removal, release tags, or publishing.
- **AutoFlow3 boundary.** AutoFlow3 is the single workflow, gate, and evidence
  control plane. It may automate patch-level mechanical changes only when
  policy checks prove no public API, package topology, release-policy,
  runtime-default, security, auth, database, or minor/major roadmap impact.
  Minor, major, and v1 decisions require human ADR plus approved version-plan
  evidence.
- **Protocol first-class.** Core rendering, adapter, island/hydration, signal,
  data, route-manifest, runtime, cache, storage, and component-adapter contracts
  live in `@openelement/protocol` with conformance tests.

```

Live JSR publish and post-publish JSR consumer smoke run after
repository-controlled gates, dev/main CI, merge, and tag/release work. For
v0.39+ release closure, JSR publish evidence is required unless a later ADR
approves an explicit exception.
