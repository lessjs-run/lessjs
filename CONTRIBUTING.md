# Contributing to openElement

Read first: `docs/governance/PROJECT_WORKFLOW.md`.

openElement uses AutoWorkflow for project management. A change should identify
the version SOP, ADR impact, NextVersion package, implementation evidence, and
release-document impact before it is merged.

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-element/openelement.git
cd openelement
deno task dev
deno task build
deno task test
```

## Before Submitting a PR

Run the workflow and quality gates that match the change:

```bash
deno task workflow:check
deno task arch:check
deno task graph:check
deno task docs:check-current
deno task docs:check-strategy
deno task fmt:check
deno task lint
deno task typecheck
deno task test
deno task build
```

For release work, also run the release gates listed in
`docs/status/STATUS.md`.

## Code Style

- TypeScript with Deno.
- Single quotes, semicolons, 2-space indent.
- Prefer structured APIs and AST/manifest boundaries over source regex.
- Keep one renderer pipeline and one metadata source of truth.
- Use `createLogger()` for logging where package code already has logger
  access.
- Reference ADR numbers when comments explain architectural decisions.

## Release Process

Release work must follow `docs/governance/PROJECT_WORKFLOW.md`. Do not bump
packages until implementation gates pass. Do not merge `dev` to `main` until
`dev` CI is green. Do not tag until `main` CI is green.
